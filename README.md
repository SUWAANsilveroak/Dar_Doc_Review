# Google Play Store Data Analysis Project

# **NOTE** *

**This project is hosted privately on GitHub, with controlled access managed through a third-party application, GitFront, allowing only selected viewers to access the repository.** 

**For the best experience, it is recommended to download the raw files for "Google_review_project.ipynb" and "DarDoc-Report.pdf" and open them in your preferred code editor (ideally, VS Code).** 

**This ensures that all elements of the code file are displayed correctly, as certain components may not be as user-friendly in other viewers.**

## Project Objective
The objective of this project is to collect, analyze, and extract actionable insights from data sourced from the Google Play Store. The findings aim to support the **Customer Support (CS) team** in making informed decisions and improving service strategies.

## Project Deliverables
- **Cleaned and Documented Dataset**: A refined dataset, ready for analysis, free from inconsistencies and missing data.
- **Comprehensive Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Visual and statistical analysis showcasing trends such as:
  - Popular app categories
  - User ratings distribution
  - Common user feedback themes
- **Feature-Engineered Data**: Enhanced data points that reveal deeper insights into app performance and user behavior.
- **Final Report**: A detailed report highlighting key takeaways and actionable recommendations for the CS team to improve support strategies.

## Methodology
1. **Data Collection**: Data was sourced from the Google Play Store through API calls and web scraping.
2. **Data Cleaning**: Processes included handling missing values, removing duplicates, and standardizing data formats.
3. **Exploratory Data Analysis**: Visual and analytical insights were generated using Python libraries such as Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn.
4. **Feature Engineering**: Additional data features were created to uncover deeper relationships within the dataset.
5. **Reporting**: Key findings were compiled into a report format for easy reference and actionable insights.

## Key Findings
- **Top App Categories**: Certain categories like `Games` and `Productivity` showed a high number of user downloads.
- **User Ratings**: The distribution of user ratings highlighted that most apps fell within the 4-5 star range.
- **Feedback Themes**: Common themes from user feedback were identified, such as app performance and user interface issues.

## Recommendations for the CS Team
- Focus on apps within popular categories for targeted support and updates.
- Address feedback themes related to performance and UI to improve user satisfaction.
- Leverage insights from user ratings to prioritize high-impact updates.
