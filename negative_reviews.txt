I signed up for the DarDoc Weight Loss Program Subscription. Unfortunately the app does not work properly for the Weight Loss Program. The app crashes or does not load properly and I had to use the WhatsApp help team for each step of the program.
The worse experience ever not recommended it to anyone
The app isnt loading after the update
I used one health test of DarDoc as I had some symptoms and their Lab produced a false negative result. Going to another service provider I got the positive result. This delayed me in receiving prescription meds by one week. Don't use!!
NOT ABLE TO BOOK AN APPOINTMENT
Your ID scanner doesnt work. Quite disappointing. We really needed your service today but cannot use coz of that
Bug in the app
From a UX designer perspective, the entire experience is off-putting. There should be a website link opening when a person clicks the link and not forcing the app on user. Then forcing them to sign in n add address n phone. The simple thing that a user should be able to check charges as soon as they open the website will be a good interface to begin with and then maybe giving them an incentive that through app they can have xyz amount of discount via app only. I struggled so much
Delivery of PCR test service was late and messy, i was in contact with founders for getting reimbursed and one month later still no news (after many follow ups) A pity, i do not recommend this app.
How install and gave me no booking directly without ask for the date
doesn't work very well. you sign up and receive the code and the the screen just hangs at the log in. tried it on ios too and the same thing
